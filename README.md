- **React** & **Next.js** for building dynamic, high-performance user interfaces.
- **Strapi** & **Drupal** for powerful content management solutions.
- **REST APIs** and a bit of **GraphQL** for efficient data fetching.
- And, of course, Iâ€™m well-versed in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**!

I love tackling new challenges and collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of web development. Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out if youâ€™d like to connect!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
